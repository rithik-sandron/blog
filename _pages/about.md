Hey there! 👋 **The story of Zero**
began when we needed a space to share our thoughts and get creative.
Zero has become our cozy corner to let our imaginations run wild and
we'd like to let you all in on it. Feel right at home and dive into our
short, fun reads on just about anything! The name Zero signifies the
starting point for all of us!

You might come across a few Japanese words here and there. That's
because we're huge anime fans and we like using these fancy little
words, not that we actually know Japanese, haha. 😅

We're a team of enthusiastic individuals passionate about researching 🔎
and writing ✍️ on various topics. The articles you find here are based
solely on our perspectives 🧠
